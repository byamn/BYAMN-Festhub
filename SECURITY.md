## Security Considerations

### Client-Side Security

This project is a client-side web application with the following security considerations:

1. **No Sensitive Data Storage**: No user data is stored on servers
2. **External Dependencies**: We use CDN resources for fonts and icons
3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: User input is properly sanitized
4. **Content Security Policy**: Recommended for deployment

### Recommended Deployment Security

When deploying BYAMN Festhub:

1. **HTTPS Only**: Always serve over HTTPS
2. **Security Headers**: Implement proper security headers
3. **Content Security Policy**: Restrict resource loading
4. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs

Example security headers:
```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' cdnjs.cloudflare.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' fonts.googleapis.com cdnjs.cloudflare.com; font-src fonts.gstatic.com; img-src 'self' data: https:;
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

## Third-Party Dependencies

Current external dependencies:
- Font Awesome (Icons)
- Google Fonts (Typography)
- External ad networks (if applicable)

We regularly monitor these dependencies for security updates.
